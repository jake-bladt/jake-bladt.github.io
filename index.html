      <h3>Who?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Jake Bladt</strong> - a professional software creator. For most of my professional career, my title has involved the words "software" and either "developer" or "engineer." But, I've done most of the jobs that involve getting software from concept to product at some point.
      </p> 

      <h3>What are you doing now?</h3>
      <p>
      In my current role, I'm working for a medical transport company and most of my day-to-day work involves automation, deployment, site reliability, measurement, and infrastructure-as-code. My title is "senior DevOps engineer."
      </p>

      <h3>Keywords! I need keywords! What tools are you using?</h3>
      <p>
      Most of my work is currently done using Amazon Web Services (AWS,) Docker, Terraform, and CircleCI. Pretty much every day, I write something in Python and/or JavaScript. Nearly everything I do lives on Linux.
