      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p>Frequently asked questions about me (mostly delivered via unsolicited e-mail.)</p> 

      <h3>Who?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Jake Bladt</strong> - a professional software creator. For most of my professional career, my title has involved the words "software" and either "developer" or "engineer." But, I've done most of the jobs that involve getting software from concept to product at some point.
      </p> 

      <h3>What are you doing now?</h3>
      <p>
      In my current role, I'm working for a medical transport company and most of my day-to-day work involves automation, deployment, site reliability, measurement, and infrastructure-as-code. My title is "senior DevOps engineer."
      </p>

      <h3>Keywords! I need keywords! What tools are you using?</h3>
      <p>
      Most of my work is currently done using Amazon Web Services (AWS,) Docker, Terraform, and CircleCI. Almost every day, I write something in Python and/or JavaScript. Nearly everything I do lives on Linux. 
      </p>

      <h3>Is that it?</h3>
      <p>
      No. While this is my first role as a full-time devops specialist, I've done a lot of deployment, automation, and testing-based work in my life as a software developer. In addition to writing software in C# and JavaScript, I've spent hundreds of hours automating deployments and testing on both Windows Azure and AWS and creating distributed, cloud-hosted systems that run in parallel on thousands of virtual servers.
      </p>

      <p>
      Roughly 75% of the code I've written in the last fifteen years has been in C#, Python, or JavaScript, but I've also worked in Ruby and Java recently enough to get back into them pretty quickly.
      </p>

      <h3>More! I need MORE KEYWORDS</h3>

      <p>
      Ok. Fine. Within the last five years, I've used SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j, Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, ZeroMQ, Redis, Zookeeper, ASP.net MVC, Ruby on Rails, Angular, KnockoutJS, Handlebars, Raphael, and jQuery.
