Mid-life crises get a bad rap. Sure, a lot of guys address theirs with sports cars and marital infidelity. But, they usually come at a time when you've got 20+ years to retirement and at a time when that slow slide into mediocrity can still be reversed or can turn into a ten-story, gut-bending roller coaster ride.

Living in NYC, I don't want *any* car. And chasing tail is like baseball. You're probably going to peak around 26 and it takes a real superstar to keep doing it into his forties without embarrassing himself. And, while I would like to recapture my glory days, they were never about cars, sports, or sex. They were about feeling like the smartest guy in the room (sometimes) and being "good at math."
