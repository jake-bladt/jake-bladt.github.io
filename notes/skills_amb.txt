Ambulnz, Senior DevOps Engineer

Jake is currently the senior devops engineer at Ambulnz, a medical transport company in New York and Los Angeles and is responsible for automation, deployment, testing, and code quality initiatives. Highlights:

* Daily Deploy: Through integration with JIRA, Github, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, automated the deployment process to the point where regression testing and deployments can occur daily instead of every 4-8 weeks.
*  PR Instances: Created a custom webhook for pull request changes in Github that launches a full, isolated containerized version of our node-based web services along with supporting services. Used NodeJS, Python, bash scripts, docker, docker-compose, terraform, and AWS automation.
